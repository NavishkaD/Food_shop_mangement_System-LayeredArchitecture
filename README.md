## Food shop mangement System - layered architecture

The purpose of my project entitled as “Food_shop_mangement_System” is to computerize the Front Office Management of food shop and to develop software which is user friendly, simple, fast, and cost – effective. It deals with the collection of Customer information and Employee information, Order details, etc. Traditionally, it was done manually.

My system is very user friendly and written in Java and MySQL. The owner and receptionist can access the system. Owner has full access to the system he can do anything. For example, add, delete and edit Order and employees.
